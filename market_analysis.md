# HireMind AI - Market Analysis & Strategy

## 1. Market Problem
**The Core Issue:** The recruitment industry is plagued by inefficiency, bias, and volume overload.
- **Resume Fatigue:** Recruiters spend an average of 7-10 seconds per resume, often missing qualified candidates due to volume.
- **Unconscious Bias:** Human screening is susceptible to biases based on name, gender, education, or background.
- **Time-to-Hire:** The average time to fill a tech role is 40+ days, costing companies lost productivity.
- **Poor Candidate Experience:** "Ghosting" candidates is common because recruiters cannot manually communicate with every applicant.

**The Solution:** HireMind AI automates the screening, ranking, and engagement process, acting as an always-on AI recruiter that shortlists the top 1% of talent instantly.

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
We will target three distinct segments, rolling out in phases:

*   **Pain Point:** Need to hire *fast* with high accuracy; cannot afford expensive bad hires.
*   **Region:** North America, India, Europe (Remote-first focused).

### Secondary ICP (Scale)
*   **Segment:** Mid-Market Companies (50-500 employees).
*   **Persona:** HR Managers & Talent Acquisition Leads.
*   **Pain Point:** standardizing hiring processes and reducing agency spend.
